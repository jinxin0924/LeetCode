# Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
# write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
#
# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
#  "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
#  and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
#
# For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5],
#  which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received
#  3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
# and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
